# KnowSeq
KnowSeq proposes a whole pipeline that comprises the most relevant steps in the RNA-seq gene expression analysis. In this sense, this package allows align raw data from the original fastq files by using the most renowned aligners such as tophat2, hisat2, salmon and kallisto. This is the most important implementation of this package as with only a text file with the information of the samples to align, the tool will perform the download and alignment of all of them automatically with the selected aligner. Furthermore, the package includes functions to calculate the gene expression values, to remove batch effect, to calculate the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), to plot different graphs, and to perform the DEGs enrichment with the GO information, pathways visualization and related diseases information retrieval.
