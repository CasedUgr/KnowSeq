\title{DEGsToDiseases obtains the information about what diseases are related to the DEGs indicated by parameter.}
\usage{
DEGsToDiseases(geneList, minCitation = 5, size = 10, getEvidences = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{geneList}{A list that contains the gene symbols or gene names of the DEGs.}

\item{minCitation}{Minimum number of citations of each genes in a disease to consider the genes related with the disease.}

\item{size}{The number of diseases to retrieve from targetValidation}

\item{getEvidences}{Boolean. If true, for each gene, a list of found evidences for each disease will be returned.}
}
\value{
A list which contains the information about the diseases associated to each genes or to a set of genes. If getEvidences is TRUE, found evidences for each case will be returned too.
}
\description{
The function obtains the information about what diseases are related to the DEGs indicated by parameter. For that, the function makes use of the web platforms gene2Diseases and targetValidation.
