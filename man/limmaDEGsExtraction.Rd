\title{limmaDEGsExtraction performs the analysis to extract the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) among the classes to compare.}
\usage{
limmaDEGsExtraction(expressionMatrix, labels, pvalue = 0.05, lfc = 1,
  cov = 1, number = Inf, svaCorrection = FALSE, svaMod)
}
\arguments{
\item{expressionMatrix}{The expressionMatrix parameter is an expression matrix or data.frame that contains the genes in the rows and the samples in the columns.}

\item{labels}{A vector or factors that contains the labels for each of the samples in the expressionMatrix parameter.}

\item{pvalue}{The value of the p-value which determines the DEGs. If one or more genes have a p-value lower or equal to the selected p-value, they would be considered as DEGs.}

\item{lfc}{The value of the LFC which determines the DEGs. If one or more genes have a LFC greater or equal to the selected LFC, they would be considered as DEGs.}

\item{cov}{This value only works when there are more than two classes in the labels. This parameter stablishs a minimum number of pair of classes combination in which exists differential expression to consider a genes as expressed genes.}

\item{number}{The maximum number of desired genes as output of limma. As default, the function returns all the extracted DEGs with the selected parameters.}

\item{svaCorrection}{A logical variable that represents if the model for limma is calculated or indicated by parameter from the output of \code{\link{batchEffectRemoval}} function by using sva method.}

\item{svaMod}{The model calculated by \code{\link{batchEffectRemoval}} function by using sva method.}
}
\value{
A list that contains two objects. The table with statistics of the different DEGs and a reduced expression matrix which contains the DEGs and the samples.
}
\description{
The function performs the analysis to extract the Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) among the classes to compare. The number of final DEGs can change depending on the p-value and the LFC indicated by parameters of the function. Furthermore, the function detects if the number of classes are greater than 2 to perform a multiclass DEGs analysis.
