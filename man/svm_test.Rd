\title{svm_test allows assessing the final DEGs through a machine learning step by using SVM with a test dataset.}
\usage{
svm_test(train, labelsTrain, test, labelsTest, vars_selected, bestParameters)
}
\arguments{
\item{train}{The train parameter is an expression matrix or data.frame that contains the train dataset with the genes in the columns and the samples in the rows.}

\item{labelsTrain}{A vector or factor that contains the train labels for each of the samples in the train object.}

\item{test}{The test parameter is an expression matrix or data.frame that contains the test dataset with the genes in the columns and the samples in the rows.}

\item{labelsTest}{A vector or factor that contains the test labels for each of the samples in the test object.}

\item{vars_selected}{The genes selected to classify by using them. It can be the final DEGs extracted with the function \code{\link{DEGsExtraction}} or a custom vector of genes. Furthermore, the ranking achieved by \code{\link{featureSelection}} function can be used as input of this parameter.}

\item{bestParameters}{Best values for C and gamma parameters selected during the training phase.}
}
\value{
A list that contains four objects. The confusion matrix, the accuracy, the sensitibity and the specificity for each genes.
}
\description{
svm_test allows assessing the final DEGs through a machine learning step by using SVM with a test dataset. An optimization of C and G hiperparameters is done at the start of the process.
